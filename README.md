# Cyber-Attack-Detection-In-Cyber-Physical-System-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning

Machine learning techniques has been used to accurately parse such data of Cyber-physical systems to detect attacks. In this paper, we use four different supervised machine learning algorithms to build models to detect cyber-attack activities on a CPS the water treatment plant. The result of the four classification models K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RT) are compared on the base of evaluation matrices to perform the comparative analysis.
